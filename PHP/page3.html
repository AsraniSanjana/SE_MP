            People with COVID-19 have had a wide range of symptoms reported – ranging from mild symptoms to severe illness. Symptoms may appear 2-14 days after exposure to the virus. Anyone can have mild to severe symptoms. People with these symptoms may have COVID-19:
            
            Fever or chills, 
            Cough,
            Shortness of breath or difficulty breathing, 
            Fatigue,  
            Muscle or body aches, 
            Headache, 
            New loss of taste or smell, 
            Sore throat, 
            Congestion or runny nose, 
            Nausea or vomiting, 
            Diarrhea, 
            <br><br><br>
            This list does not include all possible symptoms. CDC will continue to update this list as we learn more about COVID-19. Older adults and people who have severe underlying medical conditions like heart or lung disease or diabetes seem to be at higher risk for developing more serious complications from COVID-19 illness.</h3>

          <p style="text-align: center;">
            <span style="line-height: 2.0;"> Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that are known to cause illness ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS).

              A novel coronavirus (COVID-19) was identified in 2019 in Wuhan, China. This is a new coronavirus that has not been previously identified in humans.
              
              This course provides a general introduction to COVID-19 and emerging respiratory viruses and is intended for public health professionals, incident managers and personnel working for the United Nations, international organizations and NGOs.
              
              As the official disease name was established after material creation, any mention of nCoV refers to COVID-19, the infectious disease caused by the most recently discovered coronavirus.</p>

             <h4> WHO advice for high-risk populations:</h4>
              <br><br>

1. When having visitors at your home, extend  “1-meter greetings”, like a wave, nod or bow. <br>
2. Request that visitors and those who live with you, wash their hands.<br>
3. Clean and disinfect surfaces in your home (especially those that people touch a lot) on a regular basis.<br>
4. Limit shared spaces if someone you live with is not feeling well (especially with possible COVID-19 symptoms).<br>
5. If you show signs and symptoms of COVID-19 illness, contact your healthcare provider by telephone, before visiting your healthcare facility.<br>
6. Have an action plan in preparation for an outbreak of COVID-19 in your community.<br>
7. When you are in public, practice the same preventative guidelines as you would at home.<br>
8. Keep updated on COVID-19 through obtaining information from reliable sources.<br>
